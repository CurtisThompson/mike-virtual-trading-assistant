The MIKE ChatBot is designed to answer basic queries about stocks and sectors on the FTSE 100 index. 

Queries you may make include:
	- "What is the price of X?" to get the absolute price
	- "How is X doing?" to get a percentage change value
	- "absolute price change STOCK" to get the absolute price change of a stock that day
where X is a stock or sector from the index. 

The system can also provide a 'stock summary' on request. The best way to learn the usage and abilities of the system is through trial and error. 

The interface is very self explanatory. Note that audio can be muted/unmuted by clicking the toggle light on the top banner within the window. The application may be minimised to the tray when not in use.
